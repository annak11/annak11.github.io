                   Let me introduce myself, my name is Anna. I was born 
                   in the 11 th of July, 1998 in Zugdidi,  Georgia.
                   Unfortunatly, my life isn't so interesting as it seems. 
                   Well, I have goals... It is very important to have plans for the future.
                   I know I must do my best to achieve it. 
                   Firstly, it’s to learn Spanish and German, those are my 
                   favourite languages. Secondly, I want study abroad, to get second higher education.
                   Thirdly, it’s of course to travel around the world, to meet 
                   new people and discover new places for myself. And, finally, find myself and get a worthy job.
                   I have a hobby, I am keen on... I cannot say that I have a lot of free time for my hobby because it takes
                   me much time to get ready for my University.
                   But sometimes i can do what I want and like.
